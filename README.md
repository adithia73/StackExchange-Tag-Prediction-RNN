ðŸ§  StackExchange Tag Prediction with RNN, LSTM & GRU
Automatically predict relevant tags for a StackExchange question using the body of the question. This project explores deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU) for multi-label text classification.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to predict appropriate tags for StackExchange questions using their content. This is a multi-label classification task where each question can have multiple tags.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Kaggle - StackOverflow Stats Questions

Files Used: Questions.csv, Tags.csv

License: CC-BY-SA 3.0 (Attribution required)

ðŸ§ª Approach
ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Preparation
Loaded both Questions.csv and Tags.csv.

Merged datasets on the Id field.

Cleaned the Body of each question using:

BeautifulSoup for HTML removal

Lowercasing, special character filtering, stopword removal

ðŸ”¹ 2. Tag Processing
Selected top 10 most frequent tags.

Filtered rows with at least 2 of those top 10 tags.

Applied MultiLabelBinarizer to encode tags into a binary matrix.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Text Preprocessing
Tokenized and vectorized question body using Tokenizer from Keras.

Limited vocabulary size and applied padding to a max length (max_len=100).

ðŸ§  Model Architectures
Three deep learning models were implemented and compared:

âœ… RNN Model

Embedding -> SimpleRNN -> Dense -> Output(sigmoid)
âœ… LSTM Model

Embedding -> GRU -> Dense -> Output(sigmoid)
All models used binary_crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer.

Models were trained with checkpointing on validation loss.

ðŸ“Š Evaluation Strategy
Predicted tag probabilities for validation samples.

Tuned the classification threshold from 0.01 to 0.50.

Chose the best threshold based on macro F1-score.

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score
RNN	0.7940	0.84	0.79	0.81
LSTM	0.8051	0.85	0.80	0.82
GRU	0.8112	0.86	0.81	0.83

âœ… GRU yielded the best macro F1-score and general accuracy.
